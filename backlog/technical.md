## *PBL-mec* : Mechanics
This is a classification of the mechanical constraints. The main constraint is to design a mechanical device to scan a 60° sector with an ultrasonic beam 15 times per second. This constraint can be divided into several constraints, that can be specified too. An ID is attributed to each of the constraints, taking their dependences into account. This creates a kind of "tree structure".

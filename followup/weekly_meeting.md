ToDo before clinical trials

* Mechanics : miniaturize and encapsulate device
* Electronics / Embedded systems
* Software : Finalize UX/UI and rendering pipeline

About certification \(CE\), we need :

* to pass a bench of technic/safety tests @todo WHAT IS THE LIST OF THE TESTS ?
* clinical trials

Roadmap

to establish the roadmap, we need information :

* what delay between industrial prototype and small series ? --&gt; related to WP3 of industrialization
* are there iterations before producing the industrial prototype ? 
* what are the precise rules for CE certification ? what about clinical trials ? are we obliged to do some ? if so, what are the conditions ? if we modify the device after the clinical trials, are they still valid ?
* What is the list of tests the prototype has to pass before clinical trials ? biocompatibility etc ?
* when do we need to begin the process of follow-up for certification ?
* documentation for certification : do we need to begin before we have a first functioning prototype ?
* Coordination with industrial pipe : do they confirm we will get the design of electronic card and mechanics by the end of 2017 ?
* Need to have more precise information about deadlines and deliverables considered by industrial pipe

What will be delivered by the industrial pipe :

* design of electronic card + integration & miniaturization
* design of mechanics
* embedded software development
* Mobile app

## Schedule and context

Putting into context the last sessions and the work program of the next months, namely the guiding questions

* What are we doing ?
* With who ?
* How we do it ?

this session is dedicated to the “What" part

## the “What" part at a strategic level

Principles of action in the community :

@luc we must act a “Make" principle : people that one to do, does \#responsibility

@bivi suggest to have a clear view of human resources & needs

human resources -&gt; volunteers, students, pros / Altran, experts as researchers  
in front of which there are needs : medical device + side needs experimental, exploratory

@aurelie @nowami suggests that this not “What” part but the “How"

## What is the focus : industrial pipe +/- community based developments

So the focus is -&gt; Do we go through to the only industrial pipe or do we go to industrial pipe + community kit-based pipe ?

Consensus about going to the only industrial pipe

In this circumstances, what do we do with students proposed by bunch of engineering school ?

consensus about the fact that students will hold problems that are not critical for the fist version of the device but whose work will have impact on further developments.

@bivi warns that process & documentation must be one of our main obsession : format production - quality insurance  
@nowami suggests

## the “What" part at a practical level

* So we have to answer 3 questions : what are the main issues related to

* industrial pipe

so we need to

* find transducer
* material for the head probe
* exploring acoustic mirror 
* electronic board design

* to be developed from the kit to serve the industrial pipe

  * characterisation :  mesure bench 
  * phantoms
  * mobile app : protocol for clinical study, UI, sharing, cloud issue 

* what is to be done students : for the future versions

  * IA : assistance operation,  
  * signal processing : transducer precise characterisation
  * GPU / FPGA
  * android’s VULCAN technology 

## CR Followup Meeting 05-07-2017

Luc J - **@luc** /  
Loic - **@hackholite** /  
Clement - **@clecoued**

## Sigproc

* lost password functionnality done by @hackholite

* remains:

  * integration of multi reference images
  * deploy in production

## Community examples

**Arduino** - fondation + entreprise  
2 peoples

merge both entities  
no external contributors  
split soft and hardware

**Rasberry Pi** - small company

**ESP8266**  
first similar project to Arduino + Wifi module

**Maker Bot**

**Open IRM **

**Open Source Medical Hardware**

### Identify and discuss project core elements

* What are we doing ?
* With who ?
* How we do it ?

### Basics

Association: cf Association Goals

General assembly - existing big picture:

* create a prototype with medical standards

  * medical image quality - success
  * clinical interpretability - in progress

  * clinical trials in June 2018 - to come

* community impact - support industrial project

### Community status ?

Do we interface community with industrial project ?

How do we interface community with industrial project ?

What a contributor is looking for in echOpen project ?

How do we give values to contributors ?

How we valorize community ? competences available and contributions

Do we grow communities and how ?

What we expect from contributors ?

Which community models could be similar to ours ?

### What are the projects ?

Do we focus on a single project \(industrial project\) ?

If not, what are the side projects ?

**Brainstorm on projects**

### What is the roadmap ?

** Determine the milestones to complete the project/s **

### How do we find and allocate resources ?

Do we need more resources ?

### Communication ?

**Action Plan:**

* state of the art - existing similar community models
* Calendar of the topic we will process
* secondary projects

attending : Jérôme D. / Benoît V. / Olivier F. / Mehdi B. / Alister T. / Aurélie M.

## Medicotechnical gitbook

* "How to contribute" section is complete, needs for beta-testing --&gt; @alister will read it and make some remarks
* Need to include Mechanics in the medicotechnical gitbook + create github repo / teams for mechanics
  * There will be two "parallel" sides of the mechanics : the one for "test bench" + the one for the real probe. In an ideal case, releases will include both. 
  * @Benoît will complete the "mechanics" section in the backlog
* "Find your team" section : add links to slack channels
* Software : 
  * development ok, needs to plug on the device to test --&gt; this will be done on wednesday
  * documentation is ongoing, will be ok by the end of the week
  * @lecoued made a huge cleaning of the code
  * next release : unit tests to be implemented
* Activity report : almost done, @benchoufi is on it :\)

## Mechanics

* @Benoit has made a prototype in polystyrene
* Due to mechanical constrains, the section related with one image won't be a perfect plan --&gt; ok for tests, but obviously not for medical applications
* need for transducers to test the encapsulation

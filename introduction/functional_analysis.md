# Functional analysis

We have defined three main functions of our device:

The sensing function that focus on the sensor (the transducer) and the motion of this sensor. The signal processing function that focus on the signal (line by line) and how to process it (electrically or numerically) so that it can be interpretable. The user interface function that focus on the image, how to process and display it.

## Sensing function

The sensing function is composed of three sub-functions: emitting, receiving and sweeping.

## Signal processing function

The signal processing function is composed of four sub-functions: amplifying, filtering, envelope detecting and pixel calculating.

## User interface function

The user interface function is composed of three sub-functions: displaying, setting and image processing.

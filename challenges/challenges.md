# Challenges

A challenge is a problem encountered in the development of the device but that isn't related to a specific iteration. This means that anybody can suggest a solution at anytime ! One does not need to join a team to take part to a challenge.

If you want to learn about one of those challenges, just click on the corresponding link and you will find everything you need: a description of the problem, code, ideas, so on and so forth. If you have any question or if you think you found something interesting, please contact us on slack or by e-mail \(contact@echopen.org\) !

Here is a list of ongoing challenges :

* [GPU & real time processing](/challenges/gpu-and-real-time-processing.md): real time processing is one of the greatest challenges echOpen's software has to face.

* [Data format](/challenges/data_format/data-format.md): create an echOpen "open file data format" for all files created with the echOpen kits. It has to be compatible with DICOM, a format commonly used in medical imaging.

* [Hetic school challenge](/challenges/hetic-school-challenge.md)

* [Analog envelope detection](/challenges/envelope_detection/analog_envelope_detection.md): suggest a better solution to perform analog envelope detection.

# Challenges

A challenge is a problem encountered in the development of the device but that isn't related to a specific iteration. This means that anybody can suggest a solution at anytime ! One does not need to join a team to take part to a challenge.

We are currently working on the launch of new challenges ! If you want to contribute anyway you can still contact us and [join a team](/howto/teams.md) !

# Contribution guide

All the prototyping contributions are done through the [echOpen GitHub](https://github.com/echopen).

Each team has its own [repository](https://github.com/echopen). We use [GitHub teams](https://github.com/orgs/echopen/teams) to materialize the relationship between team members and handle access rights to our repositories. Each team has at least one maintainer \(or owner\) who is in charge of the corresponding repo.

We use [GitHub project boards](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) to manage the ongoing tasks within the [iteration planning](../inprogress/planning.md). Each team has several project boards allowing its members to get an overview of the state of progress, and to assign themselves some tasks.

## Become a contributor

**To become a contributor, start by creating your own **[**GitHub account**](https://github.com/join)**. Send an e-mail to **[**contact@echopen.org**](/contact@echopen.org)** to be added as a member of the **[**echOpen GitHub organization**](https://github.com/echopen)**. Please let us know your GitHub username.**  
_This is necessary for you to follow the steps described below ! Once you're part of the echOpen organization, you can :_

* Explore our [team list](https://github.com/orgs/echopen/teams) and **subscribe** to the one\(s\) that you would like to integrate
* Fork the team's repo  
  To know more about forking on GitHub, jump to the [help page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

* Explore the team's project boards. Needs for contribution correspond to cards that are in the "To Do" or "Top Priority" lists.

* To contribute to some tasks, assign yourself the corresponding issue and move the card to "In Progress". Assignement to tasks is not exclusive. If you're interested in helping on some task already assigned to a contributor, just assign yourself the task as well and write a comment on the corresponding issue to get in touch with your co-workers. **For the sake of project management, please only assign yourself tasks that you will actually work on!**

* Once the task is complete, check that your contribution fulfills the "closing criteria" that are detailed in the corresponding issue.

* Make a pull request referencing the issue  
  To know more about pull requests on GitHub, jump to the [help page](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

* Move the card to "Done". You're done !

# Protocol for comparing envelope detection methods

## Context

The aim is to determine a very simple protocol to compare different solutions for the envelope extraction which allows to construct the image from the raw electrical signals. This step can be either performed analogically or numerically. The last stable version of the echOpen prototype implements a digital envelope extraction based on a Hilbert transform.

We now would like to answer two questions :

* Is it possible to

# Use cases Android App

1. Application launch

   1.1 user should acces to image visualisation quickly after the application starts

2. Echography image visualisation

   2.1. user accesses a full screen displaying the image caught by the ultrasound probe

3. Echography image manipulation

   3.1. user can adjust image contrast in order to get a better look to details inside organs. This helps the operator to detect anomalies, often revealed by contrast breaks

# Functional Specs Android App

1. Application launch

   1.1. The application displays a Splashscreen in order to prepare loading of the heavy components.

2. Echography image visualisation

   2.1 user accesses a screen displaying the image caught by the ultrasound probe

   * the image is a full screen image

   * the image frame rates relies heavily on what is transmitted by the hardware. Today, the frame-rate is 2 frames per second.

     * the image is displayed in a conic shape, due to ScanConversion processing. This is done through

3. the image has been pre-filtered to remove noise, This is done through a detection envelope algorithm corresponding to Hilbert transform implementation

4. Echography image manipulation

   3.1 user can adjust image contrast in order to get a better look to details inside organs. This helps the operator to detect anomalies, often revealed by contrast breaks

   * Contrast can be adjusted by selecting a customized intensity-to-pixels linear or exponential look-up table.

   * The image intensity can also be amplified uniformally through a gain filter

5. Communication with echOpen hardware Device

   4.1 connection to remote echOpen device is relying on websocket communication

   4.2 image data are received as pixel streams in TCP, or local \(from an asset file\) format

   * the are two modes

     * the TCP mode, the raw data come from the hardware as stream of pixels

       * the first image thrown by the hardware carries as its first bytes the header information 
       * the first 2 bytes of the packet corresponds to the number of lines

     * the local mode, the image are fetched from a local folder and so emulates the real ones

   * image filters are implemented in order to improve contrast and image quality. These settings will then be reported in the production app, without letting the user to modify them -&gt; @clecoued for more details

     * each image pixel is encoded with 2 bytes

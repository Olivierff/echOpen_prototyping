Here you can learn a little more things about the main signal processing issues such as:

* [Image quality assesment](/references/sigproc/IMGQ_metrics.md).

* [Tissue mimicking phantoms](/references/sigproc/phantoms.md)

* [Digital enveloppe detection click](/references/sigproc/enveloppe_extraction.md).

We are working on a fourth subsection about denoising. It will be online soon.

nota bene: if you have never heard about tissues mimicking phantoms, you should read the page about image quality assesment first.

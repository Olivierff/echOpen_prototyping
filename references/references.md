# References

In this section, each team has its own space to share information, references, articles, etc...

In the [mechanics subsection](/references/mechanics/mechanical_issues.md) you will find an interesting file that provides simple explanations about the mechanical issues.

In the [signal processing subsection](/references/ref_sigproc.md) you will find explanations and references about different aspects of the signal processing issues encountered by our community. 

In the [Android App subsection](/references/app/ref_app.md) there is a guide to help you install Open CV, which is useful if you join that team. There is also a document about the DICOM format.

We are still working on the other subsections, they are empty for the moment.

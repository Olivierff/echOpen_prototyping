# 2017 Summer Camp

## Introduction

For the record and in order for those not implied in #SigProc and #Embsys to have an overview on what’s currently on for these teams, and even participate, we are organising weekly working session on main echOpen’s meta-challenges from a technical side

## Context

We merged #SigProc and #Embsys because the prototype and its documentation is now done. We are currently replacing this session with a weekly summer camp on main issues we have to deal as far as the technical team are impacted :

## Questions raised are

* about technical developments made by contributors
    * What are we doing ?
        * which pipes
        * roadmaps + miles(big)stones [x] (stage @ 19.07.17)
    * With who ?
    * How we do it ?

* communities
    * who does what ?
    * place of the challenges
    * valorisation of contributors
    * interactions with researchers and students eco-systems


Here’s what already happened

_28-06-2017 session_ -> mainly discussing about a putative summer schedule

_05-07-2017 session_ -> strolling on open communities governance models

_12-07-2017 session_ -> the what part ? So, you may wonder “What is What”, so have look at the GitBook reports
